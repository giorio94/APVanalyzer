# Amazon Prime Video Playback Analyzer (APVanalyzer)

This python script provides a simple way to analyze the network traces referred
to the playback of a movie and/or TV show from Amazon Prime Video. In particular,
it plots multiple graphs showing the most relevant information to study how the
player reacts to different network conditions. See the
[illustrative Jupyter Notebook](APVanalyzer.ipynb) for more
information and the description of the main functionalities provided by the
python script. *Warning*: the sample input files are not provided as part of
this repository as they may contain privacy-sensitive personal data.
The script has been developed as a project for the "Multimedia
Communications" and "Python in the Lab" courses taught at the Politecnico di
Torino (Italy).
